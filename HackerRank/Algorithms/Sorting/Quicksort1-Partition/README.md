#### Quicksort 1 - Partition
The previous challenges covered Insertion Sort, which is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm with an average case performance of *O(n2)*. In these next few challenges, we're covering a *divide-and-conquer* algorithm called Quicksort (also known as *Partition Sort*).

**Step 1: Divide**  
Choose some pivot element, *p*, and partition your unsorted array, *ar*, into three smaller arrays: *left, right*, and *equal*, where each element in *left < p* , each element in *right > p*, and each element in *equal = p*.

**Challenge**  
Given ar and p=ar[0], partition ar into left, right, and equal using the Divide instructions above. Then print each element in left followed by each element in equal, followed by each element in right on a single line. Your output should be space-separated.

**Note:** There is no need to sort the elements in-place; you can create two lists and stitch them together at the end.

**Input Format**  
The first line contains n (the size of ar). 
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing ar (the unsorted array). The first integer (corresponding to ar[0]) is your pivot element, p.

**Constraints**  
* 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000  
* −1000 ≤ x ≤ 1000, x∈ar−   
* All elements will be unique.  
* Multiple answer can exists for the given test case. Print any one of them.

**Output Format**  
On a single line, print the partitioned numbers (i.e.: the elements in left, then the elements in equal, and then the elements in right). Each integer should be separated by a single space.

| Sample Input  | Sample Output |
| ------------- |---------------|
|5              | 3 2 4 5 7     |
|4 5 3 7 2      |               |
